#  CLI Social Media App (OOP-Based)
Welcome to the CLI Social Media App, a console-based project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. This project demonstrates core OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, and offers basic features of a social media platform — all through a command-line interface.

## 📌 Features
## 🔐 Login System: 
Secure user login with username and password verification from a file.

## 👤 Personal Info Management:
Display and manage personal bio and friend list.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Friend Requests:
View and accept pending friend requests (with a 5-friend limit).

## 📰 Timeline: 
View your timeline, see others’ posts, and create your own posts.

## ❤️ Likes & Comments:
Like posts and leave comments, mimicking a real feed interaction.

## 📄 Pages: 
View pages you've interacted with and see additional page-related info.

## 🔔 Notifications:
Read notifications relevant to your activity.

## 🗣️ User Feed:
Interact with trending or public posts by liking or commenting.

## ✉️ Messages:
View personal messages, reply to them, and send new messages.

## 💡 Object-Oriented Concepts Used
✅ Encapsulation: Data hiding with accessors and mutators (getters/setters).

✅ Abstraction: User-friendly interface to hide the implementation details.

✅ Inheritance: The app class inherits from the user class.

✅ Composition: Classes like Posts, Comments, and PersonalInfo are used within user.
